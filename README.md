# Welcome!

Hi! This is the project containing the NodeJS bindings for Avocado.

*Make sure* you clone recursively. So that would look like this:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/cha0s/avocado-node.git
    
Notice the <code>--recursive</code> part!

# Building

This project requires [qmake](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtdoc/index.html) to generate the makefiles you need to compile. You can install this on Ubuntu like:

    sudo apt-get install qt-sdk
    
It's kinda heavy, sorry! Maybe I'll learn CMake eventually. :)

Anyway, once you do this, run qmake in the avocado-node directory, then make!

Docs will improve in time.

# Have a nice day!
